MonReader (Image Recognition): 

MonReader is a new mobile document digitization experience for the blind, for researchers and for everyone else in need for fast and high-quality document scanning. The goal of this project is to predict if the page is being flipped using a single image and evaluate the model's performance based on F1 score; the higher the better. An additional task is to predict if a given sequence of images contains an action of flipping.
